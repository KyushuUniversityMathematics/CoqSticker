This contribution consists in the formalization of a procedure appeared in
the automata, the sticker systems, and linear grammer. And this contribution 
includes translation procedure from the automata tothe sticker systems. 
The translation procedure was introduced by Paun and Rozenberg in 1998. 

All *.v files are implementations and examples of automata, sticker systems,
and linear grammers.
And *.vo, *.tex, and  *.pdf files are geneted by "make" command.

To use *.vo files, Coq8.4pl3+ssreflect1.5 is required.
